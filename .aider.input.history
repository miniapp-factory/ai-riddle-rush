+Code the following app
+```
+Create a mini-game app called “AI Riddle Rush.” The app should generate AI-powered riddles, check answers, give hints, and score the player across 10 rounds. Include a Start Screen with Start Game, How to Play, and High Scores. When the game begins, let the user pick a difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard). For each round, call the AI to generate a riddle in the exact format: “RIDDLE: <text>” and “ANSWER: <one word>.” Show the riddle, a 15-second timer, an answer input, a Submit button, and a Hint button. Scoring: +10 for a correct answer without hint, +5 with hint, +0 for wrong or timeout. Use AI to check the user’s answer, responding only “correct” or “incorrect.” Hints must be one-sentence clues generated by AI. After each round, show the result and a Next button. After 10 rounds, show a Final Score screen with Play Again. Use clean UI with large riddle text, visible timer, and a score/round indicator. Add basic error handling by retrying invalid AI outputs once, then falling back to a built-in riddle. The app should feel simple, fast, and fun, with smooth transitions and reliable AI formatting.
